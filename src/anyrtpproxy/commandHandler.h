 *  The secure anycast tunneling protocol (satp) defines a protocol used
 *  for communication between any combination of unicast and anycast
 *  tunnel endpoints.  It has less protocol overhead than IPSec in Tunnel
 *  mode and allows tunneling of every ETHER TYPE protocol (e.g.
 *  ethernet, ip, arp ...). satp directly includes cryptography and
 *  message authentication based on the methods used by SRTP.  It is
 *  intended to deliver a generic, scaleable and secure solution for
 *  tunneling and relaying of packets of any protocol.
