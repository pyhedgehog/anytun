 *  The secure anycast tunneling protocol (satp) defines a protocol used
 *  for communication between any combination of unicast and anycast
 *  tunnel endpoints.  It has less protocol overhead than IPSec in Tunnel
 *  mode and allows tunneling of every ETHER TYPE protocol (e.g.
 *  ethernet, ip, arp ...). satp directly includes cryptography and
 *  message authentication based on the methods used by SRTP.  It is
 *  intended to deliver a generic, scaleable and secure solution for
 *  tunneling and relaying of packets of any protocol.

    char test[] = "Anytun is an implementation of the secure anycast tunneling protocol. It uses an easy openvpn style interface and makes it possible to build redundant VPN clusters with load balancing between servers. VPN servers share a single IP address. Adding and removing VPN Servers is done by the routing protocol, so no client changes have to be made when additional VPN servers are added or removed. It is possible to realise global load balancing based on shortest BGP routes by simply announcing the address space of the tunnel servers at multiple locations. Currently ethernet, ipv4 and ipv6 tunnels are supported by the implementation. However the protocol allows one to tunnel every ETHERTYPE protocol.";
