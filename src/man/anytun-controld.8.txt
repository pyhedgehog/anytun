NAME
----
anytun-controld - anycast tunneling control daemon

SYNOPSIS
--------

*anytun-controld*
[ *-h|--help* ]
[ *-f|--file* <path> ]
[ *-X|--control-host* < <host>[:port>] | :<port> > ]
[ *-D|--nodaemonize* ]
[ *-C|--chroot* ]
[ *-u|--username* <username> ]
[ *-H|--chroot-dir* <path> ]
[ *-P|--write-pid* <path> ]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

*anytun-controld* configures the multi-connection support for *anytun*. It reads a connection/routing table and outputs it via a tcp socket to all connected *anytun* servers. When the control daemon is restarted with a new connection/routing table all *anytun* servers automatically load the new configuration. Please make sure to protect that information as it contains the connection keys.

OPTIONS
-------

-f|--file <path>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The path to the config file.

-X|--control-host < <host>[:<port>] | :<port> >
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The local ip address and or tcp port to bind to. Mind that if an 
address is given the port can be omitted in which case port 2323 
is used. You can also specify to listen on an specific port but on
all interfaces by omitting the address. If you want to specify an
ipv6 address and a port you have to use [ and ] to seperate the address
from the port, eg.: [::1]:1234. If you want to use the default port 
[ and ] can be omitted. default: 127.0.0.1:2323

-D|--nodaemonize
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This option instructs *anytun-controld* to run in the foreground
instead of becoming a daemon which is the default.

-C|--chroot
~~~~~~~~~~~

Instruct *anytun* to run in a chroot chail and drop privileges. The 
default is not to run in chroot.

-u|--username <username>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

if chroot change to this user. default: nobody

-H|--chroot-dir <directory>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

chroot to this directory. default: /var/run/anytun-controld

-P|--write-pid <path>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Instruct *anytun-controld* to write it's pid to this file. 
The default is not to create a pid file.
