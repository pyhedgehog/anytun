SYNOPSIS
--------

*anytun-controld*
[ *-h|--help* ]
[ *-D|--nodaemonize* ]

[ *-P|--write-pid* <path> ]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Anytun is an implementation of the Secure Anycast Tunneling Protocol
(SATP). Anycast provides a complete VPN solution similar to OpenVPN or
IPsec in tunnel mode. The main difference is that anycast enables the
setup of tunnels between an arbitrary combination of anycast, unicast
and multicast hosts.

OPTIONS
-------

Anytun has been designed as a peer to peer application, so there is
no difference between client and server. The following options can be
passed to the daemon:

-D|--nodaemonize
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This option instructs anytun to run in the foreground
instead of becoming a daemon.

-C|--chroot
~~~~~~~~~~~

chroot and drop privileges

-u|--username <username>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

if chroot change to this user

-H|--chroot-dir <directory>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

chroot to this directory

-P|--write-pid <path>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

write pid to this file

-P|--write-pid <path>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

path to config file
