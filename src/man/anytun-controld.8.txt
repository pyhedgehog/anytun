NAME
----
anytun-controld - anycast tunneling control daemon

SYNOPSIS
--------

*anytun-controld*
[ *-h|--help* ]
[ *-D|--nodaemonize* ]
[ *-u|--username* <username> ]
[ *-g|--groupname* <groupname> ]
[ *-C|--chroot* <path> ]
[ *-P|--write-pid* <filename> ]
[ *-L|--log* <target>:<level>[,<param1>[,<param2>[..]]] ]
[ *-f|--file* <path> ]
[ *-X|--control-host* < <host>[:port>] | :<port> > ]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

*anytun-controld* configures the multi-connection support for *anytun*. It reads a connection/routing table and outputs it via a tcp socket to all connected *anytun* servers. When the control daemon is restarted with a new connection/routing table all *anytun* servers automatically load the new configuration. Please make sure to protect that information as it contains the connection keys.

OPTIONS
-------

-D|--nodaemonize
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This option instructs *anytun* to run in foreground
instead of becoming a daemon which is the default.

-u|--username <username>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

run as this user. If no group is specified (*-g*) the default group of 
the user is used. The default is to not drop privileges.

-g|--groupname <groupname>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

run as this group. If no username is specified (*-u*) this gets ignored.
The default is to not drop privileges.

-C|--chroot <path>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Instruct *anytun* to run in a chroot jail. The default is 
to not run in chroot.

-P|--write-pid <filename>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Instruct *anytun* to write it's pid to this file. The default is 
to not create a pid file.

-L|--log <target>:<level>[,<param1>[,<param2>[..]]]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

add log target to logging system. This can be invoked several times
in order to log to different targets at the same time. Every target 
hast its own log level which is a number between 0 and 5. Where 0 means
disabling log and 5 means debug messages are enabled.

The following targets are supported:

* *syslog* - log to syslog daemon, parameters <level>[,<logname>[,<facility>]]
* *file* - log to file, parameters <level>[,<path>]
* *stdout* - log to standard output, parameters <level>
* *stderr* - log to standard error, parameters <level> 

The file target can be used more the once with different levels.
If no target is provided at the command line a single target with the 
following config is added:

*syslog:3,uanytun,daemon*

-f|--file <path>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The path to the file which holds the sync information.

-X|--control-host < <host>[:<port>] | :<port> >
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The local ip address and or tcp port to bind to. Mind that if an 
address is given the port can be omitted in which case port 2323 
is used. You can also specify to listen on an specific port but on
all interfaces by omitting the address. If you want to specify an
ipv6 address and a port you have to use [ and ] to seperate the address
from the port, eg.: [::1]:1234. If you want to use the default port 
[ and ] can be omitted. default: 127.0.0.1:2323
