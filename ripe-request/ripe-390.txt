#[NETWORK DESCRIPTION]#
%
% Please add more information if you think it will help us understand
% this request.

The IP addresses will be used for an internet experiment.

The experimental assignments will not be used for commericial purposes during or
after the experiment.

The reference implementation of the secure anycast tunneling protocol will be used to build a highly redundant and scaleable voice over ip media relay cluster.

All results of the internet experiment will be published online.

We plan to finish the experiment at the end of february 2008.
