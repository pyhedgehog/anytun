The AS number will be used for an internet experiment. 

The reference implementation of the secure anycast tunneling protocol will be used to build a highly redundant and scaleable voice over ip media relay cluster.

The experimental assignments will not be used for commericial purposes during or
after the experiment.

All results of the internet experiment will be published online.

We plan to finish the experiment at the end of february 2008.

Our peering agreements are provisional and 
will be confirmed when the new AS Number is assigned.
