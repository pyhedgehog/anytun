Abstract

   The anycast tunneling (anytun) protocol defines a protocol used for
   communication between unicast clients and anycast servers.  It can be
   used for tunneling information between 2 clients or in relay mode to
   transmit data form the client over the servers to a third party not
   using the protocol and vice versa.

1.  Introduction

   anytun defines a Host Anycast Service rfc1546.  It can be used to
   build high scalable and redundant tunnel services.  It also supports
   an IPv4 relay mode, make it possible, that only one of the connection
   endpoints has to use the anytun protocol.  This can be used to make
   connections through Firewalls or behind a NAT Router

   RFC3068 [1] DTD.

1.1.  Tunneling Mode

   In tunneling mode the payload of the anytun packet is transmitted
   from one unicast host to the anycast server.  This server makes a
   routing descision based on the underlying protocol and transmits a
   new anytun package to one or more clients depending on the routing
   descition.

1.2.  Relay Mode
