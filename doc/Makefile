##
##  The secure anycast tunneling protocol (satp) defines a protocol used
##  for communication between any combination of unicast and anycast
##  tunnel endpoints.  It has less protocol overhead than IPSec in Tunnel
##  mode and allows tunneling of every ETHER TYPE protocol (e.g.
##  ethernet, ip, arp ...). satp directly includes cryptography and
##  message authentication based on the methods used by SRTP.  It is
##  intended to deliver a generic, scaleable and secure solution for
##  tunneling and relaying of packets of any protocol.
