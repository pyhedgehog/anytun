DESCRIPTION
-----------

*anytun-controld* configures the multi-connection support for *Anytun*. It reads a connection/routing table and outputs it via a tcp socket to all connected *Anytun* servers. When the control daemon is restarted with a new connection/routing table all *Anytun* servers automatically load the new configuration. Please make sure to protect that information as it contains the connection keys.

OPTIONS
-------

*-D, --nodaemonize*::
   This option instructs *anytun-controld* to run in foreground
   instead of becoming a daemon which is the default.

*-u, --username <username>*::
   run as this user. If no group is specified (*-g*) the default group of 
   the user is used. The default is to not drop privileges.

*-g, --groupname <groupname>*::
   run as this group. If no username is specified (*-u*) this gets ignored.
   The default is to not drop privileges.

*-C, --chroot <path>*::
   Instruct *anytun-controld* to run in a chroot jail. The default is 
   to not run in chroot.

*-P, --write-pid <filename>*::
   Instruct *anytun-controld* to write it's pid to this file. The default is 
   to not create a pid file.

*-L, --log <target>:<level>[,<param1>[,<param2>[..]]]*::
   add log target to logging system. This can be invoked several times
   in order to log to different targets at the same time. Every target 
   hast its own log level which is a number between 0 and 5. Where 0 means
   disabling log and 5 means debug messages are enabled. +
   The file target can be used more the once with different levels.
   If no target is provided at the command line a single target with the 
   config *syslog:3,anytun-controld,daemon* is added. +
   The following targets are supported:

   *syslog*;; log to syslog daemon, parameters <level>[,<logname>[,<facility>]]
   *file*;; log to file, parameters <level>[,<path>]
   *stdout*;; log to standard output, parameters <level>
   *stderr*;; log to standard error, parameters <level> 

*-f, --file <path>*::
   The path to the file which holds the sync information.

*-X, --control-host <hostname|ip>[:<port>]*::
   fetch the config from this host. The default is not to use a control
   host and therefore this is empty. Mind that the port can be omitted 
   in which case port 2323 is used. If you want to specify an
   ipv6 address and a port you have to use [ and ] to separate the address
   from the port, eg.: [::1]:1234. If you want to use the default port 
   [ and ] can be omitted.

----
Most likely there are some bugs in *Anytun*. If you find a bug, please let
