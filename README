Building and Installing libSRTP:
===============================

go to https://sourceforge.net/projects/srtp/ and grab the version 1.4.4 (e.g. http://puzzle.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/srtp/srtp-1.4.4.tgz):

Then on your computer decompress it:

tar xzvf srtp-x.y.z.tgz
cd srtp
./configure
make
make install

to install libsrtp.a under /usr/local/lib/
